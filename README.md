# Translations formatter

Two core components of this deliverable:

- The Google App Script - This component interfaces with the Google Sheet of translations and handles the formatting of the cells.
- The `parser()` function - This is the JS function that breaks our test strings down into a format that we can pass to our Google app script to format with.
